# Per-test timeout: no corpus test should take longer than 10s normally
# Mark as slow after 10s, terminate after 20s if hung
slow-timeout = { period = "10s", terminate-after = 2 }

# Note: All tests in sqlparser_corpus binary are corpus tests,
# so this timeout applies to each individual SQL file test
